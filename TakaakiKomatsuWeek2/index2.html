I am going to use this degree for an IT company. I have been thinking of being 
an IT engineer and working for an IT firm. As a result, I got a job offer from 
IBM Japan, a branch of IBM in Japan. Since there are a lot of places that Math
comes into play in Computer Science, such as developing an algorithm, I will go
for it.
