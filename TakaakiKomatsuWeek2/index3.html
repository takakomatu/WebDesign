<p>In five years, I would like to be a person who is needed by colleagues, my family, and a partner. Since I am always
pleased to be needed by other people, even if I am super busy, I desire to be like that. To accomplish that, I have been
working on Java, C++, and other programming languages. You can take a look at my projects by going to my GitHub account.
